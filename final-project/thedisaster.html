        The disaster itself went on for twelve days. Men on the first day attempted to take a lift down to find trapped miners, but this ended when the lift came back up ablaze killing all the people aboard. A large ventilation fan that circulated fresh air from the top of the mine down into the shafts was reversed in the hope that it would extinguish the growing blaze. However, it simply fueled the fire and caused the fire to spread to the fanhouse and other buildings on the surface of the mine. The mine was then sealed off for several days. A small group of men were located after surviving for eight days inside a burning mine. They survived by building a makeshift wall to block off smoke, drinking from a small puddle of water, and eating shoe leather. The event made the headlines across the United States and relief came pouring in. Relief came from the government as well as from charitable organizations.
