        The mine opened in 1905 and was hailed as being one of the most modern and safe mines in the United States at the time of its opening. The mine was bountiful and was producing 300,000 tons of annually. 500 men and boys would make the journey down into the bowels of the earth every day. The town of Cherry thrived with several stores, a school, bars, and churches. Prior to the time of the disaster a 100 room hotel had been constructed and one way railroad track carried passengers and coal to the bigger mining towns of Ladd and Spring Valley.
