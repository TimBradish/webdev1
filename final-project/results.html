    <h1>Results of the Disaster</h1>

        The mine was never reopened for commerical use. The town never recovered. Widows and orphans dispersed out of the town in droves. The damage done to their families was irreversible, but the disaster did become one of the biggest factors in Illinois worker safety laws that were developed in the early 1900's. First, Illinois passed a law for better in safety in mines due to the disaster and then the disaster played a large roll in the establishment of the first workmans comp bill to be passed in Illinois in 1911. Today the town of Cherry has a population less than the number of men and boys that used to work in the mine everyday. The school that was built in 1907 closed down in early 2010's. Main street in Cherry now hosts a solitary bar that does not even serve food, a closed down rusted out gas station, two churches, and a funeral home. A memorial outside of town and near the entrance to the old mine pay respect to the people that died in the mine, but really the event is as forgotten about as the time itself.
