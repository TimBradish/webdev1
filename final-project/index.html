            The Cherry Mine Disaster happened on November 13th, 1909. The mine in Cherry had been operating for four years when an unattended wagon full of hay was left under a lit wall lamp. The wagon fire quickly spread and 259 men and boys died before it was contained. The mine in Cherry had been hyped as being a modern mine that was fireproof because it had electricity. The underground electric light system combined with the design of the main mine shift were supposed to be great safety improvements, in theory. However, the electrical system had failed a few days before the disaster, and it could be assumed the neglected cart was purely accidental due to people not being used to working around lit wall torches. It remains one of the largest mining disasters to ever happen in The United States.
