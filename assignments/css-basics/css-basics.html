    <h2>About the Show</h2>
<p> The show Outlander has been adapted for television from a book series penned by Diana Gabaldon. It is a mixture of science fiction, romance, and adventure. The show is set in Scotland, but seasons have also been set in France, the Caribbean, and the American Colonies. Claire, the main character, travels through time from the year 1944 to 1744. The show strives to be as authentic to the timeframe as possible.</p>

<h2>Historical Authenticity of the Show</h2>
 <p> Outlander has attempted to precisely recreate costumes, langauge, and customs of several different eras and cultures. The show begins being set in England in 1945 following the end of World War II. The first season is primarily set in 18th century Scotland and it does a great job of being accurate regarding the clan system of Scotland. The second season takes place in France, the creators of the show not only recreated the opening song so that it was sung in French, but also took the time to recreate and highlight the atmosphere that existed around someone like the king of France. Throughout the last several seasons the creators of the show have put extensive work into accurately recreating Native American culture during the colonial period. They have hired several Native American experts and only use Native American actors. The show always seems to try to the best of their ability to make their content as historically accurate as possible.</p>

<h2> Why I love the show</h2>
<p> The early modern era has always been an area of great interest to me. Beyond that my ancestry is heavily based out of the entire island of the UK including Scotland. The subject matter combined with the shows incessant desire to make things as accurate as possible really draws me in. </p>
