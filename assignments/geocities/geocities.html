As it is spooky season I can't help but think about classics like Goosebumps, Earnest Scared Stupid, Are You Afraid of the Dark, and Don't look Under the Bed to name a few. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091021124636/http://www.geocities.com/ender_endbringer/gravestone.gif" alt="A spooky Gravestone"> Of course beyond that there the classics like Young Frankenstein, Hocus Pocus, and The Nightmare Before Christmas. <img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20091020024641/http://es.geocities.com/pablojmcruz/Images/jack.GIF" alt="an image from Nightmare Before Christmas">

I think there also needs to be some love given to the OG Halloween figures like Dracula. <img src="https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftse1.mm.bing.net%2Fth%3Fid%3DOIP.yK1JnstPILB5ehWdG2IhcgHaDy%26pid%3DApi&f=1" alt="a classic image of Dracula">
